# Presentations

Some presentations in pdf as well as their source md (markdown) files. The corresponding html files, which are the proper versions of the talks, can be found [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/presentations/) and some discussion on using Marp to create those slides is [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/2022/Marp-for-slides).

The FIGS folder is where the locally hosted figure files are located and should not be of interest to anyone but me when I create the presentations. They are linked to in the html presentations, though, but are not needed locally (the links are to this repo).

Note that you will have to download the pdf presentations if you want to make full use of them: the github pdf files viewer does not allow to click links. Note that the pdf versions are not the proper version of the talks, as videos and Shiny apps, when present in a presentation, do not work in the pdf versions. Again, see the html versions [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/presentations/) for the correct html versions.
