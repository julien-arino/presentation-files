# Side note : health in Canada (and COVID-19)

Shared responsibility between federal government (F) and provinces/territories (P/T)

- F (PHAC, Health Canada, DND): First Nations on Reserves, Armed Forces, Federal prisonners; control of entry into national territory
	- F regulate flows RoW $\to$ CAN (federal quarantine, post-entry PCR), authorise vaccines, purchase vaccines then distribute to P/T based on population ($\setminus$ special groups)


- P/T: everything except special groups; control of entry onto P/T territory; enforcement of laws and bylaws (except when local PF are present)
	- P/T regulate flows intra- and inter-P/T (P/T quarantine, geographic exclusions - "no travel north of 53" in CAN-MB, pre-entry quarantine for CAN-NU), nature of NPI response, vaccine roll-out

# <!-- fit -->The human world is fragmented not only because of geography

- Political divisions (jurisdictions): nation groups (e.g., EU), nations, provinces/states, regions, counties, cities..
- Travel between jurisdictions can be complicated or impossible
- Data is integrated at the jurisdicional level
- Policy is decided at the jurisdictional level
- Long range mobility is a bottom$\to$top$\to$top$\to$bottom process

# <!-- fit -->Mobility is complicated but determinant in disease spatialisation

- Multiple modalities: foot, bicycle, personal vehicle, bus, train, boat, airplane
- Various durations: trip to the corner shop $\neq$ commuting $\neq$ multi-day trip for work or leisure $\neq$ relocation, immigration or refuge seeking
- Volumes are hard to fathom

And yet **mobility drives spatio-temporal spread**:
- Black Death 1347-1353 arrived in Europe and spread following trade routes
- SARS-CoV-1 spread out of HKG following the GATN

# Amplification in Wuhan (Hubei province)

- Details of emergence and precise timeline before amplification started unknown
- Amplification in Wuhan
	- Cluster of pneumonia cases mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Market
	- 27 December 2019: first report to local government
	- 31 December 2019: publication
	- 8 January 2020: identification of SARS-CoV-2 as causative agent
-  $\sim$ 23 January 2020: lockdown Wuhan and Hubei province + face mask mandates

By 29 January, virus was found in all provinces of mainland China

# Caveat : evidence of earlier spread

- Report to Wuhan authorities on 27 December 2019
- First export detections in Thailand and Japan on 13 and 16 January 2020 (with actual importations on 8 and 6 January)

$\implies$ amplification must have been occuring for a while longer

- France: sample taken from 42-year-old male (last foreign travel to Algeria in August 2019) who presented to ICU on 27 December 2019
- Retrospective studies in United Kingdom and Italy also showed undetected COVID-19 cases in prepandemic period

# Untangling the first case issue

- Robert, Rossman & Jaric. Dating first cases of COVID-19. *PLoS Pathogens* (2021). Find likely timing of first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17 (95% CI October 4)
- Pekar, Worobey, Moshiri, Scheffler & Wertheim. Timing the SARS-CoV-2 index case in Hubei province. *Science* (2021). Period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 is plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province.

Important when trying to understand global spread, so let me illustrate with the model I used (Arino & Portet. [A simple model for COVID-19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.04.002). *Infectious Disease Modelling* 2020) [taking into account model evolution since]

# <!-- fit -->Back-calculating the start of spread (example of China)

Cumulative confirmed case counts in China as reported to WHO was $c=547$ cases on $t_c=\textrm{2020-01-22}$

Let $u$ be a point in parameter space. Solve ODE numerically over $[0,t]$, with $S(0)$ the population of China, $L_1(0)=1$ and other state variables 0. This gives a solution $x(t,t_0=0,u)$. Extracting $L_2(t,t_0=0,u)$ from this solution, obtain cumulative number of new detections as
$$
C(t) = \int_{t_0=0}^{t} p\varepsilon L_2(s,t_0,u)\ ds
$$
Let $t^*$ be s.t. $C(t^*)=547$; then $t_i=\textrm{2020-01-22}-t^*$

- For SARS-CoV-1 (2003), the point of introduction on the GATN is known with certainty (Metropole Hotel, HKG, 2003-02-21)
- For SARS-CoV-2, uncertainty remains and will probably never be lifted


Back to the spatio-temporal spread of the **detected** first wave..

# Importations

- In Ecology, importations are called *introductions* and have been studied for a while, because they are one of the drivers of evolution and, more recently, because of *invasive species*

- An importation occurs when an individual who acquired the infection in a jurisdiction makes their way to another jurisdiction while still infected with the disease

- Geographies greatly influence reasoning
	- At the country level, importations quickly become less relevant
	- Consider an isolated location of 500 people.. disease may become extinct then be reimported

# <!-- fit --> Understanding variant dynamics and how to control it

- Suppose a *resident variant* is propagating in a population, say, the original wild type or, now, B.1.1.7
- A *novel variant* comes along, say B.1.617.2 (SARS-CoV-2 Delta) or B.1.1.529 (SARS-CoV-2 Omicron) that is more transmissible

**Q:**

- How long until novel replaces resident variant in terms of propagation?
- What role do importations play in this?
- How does one diminish role of importations and how useful are measures used to do so?

- *Quarantine* is indiscriminate and applies to all incoming flux
- *Isolation* is imposed to known or suspected cases and known contacts
- First used in (the lazzarettos of) Dubrovnik in 1377

# <!--- fit ---> Lessons learned & key questions/knowledge gaps

---

# Lessons learned

- Airport screening sometimes worked to detect the first imports
- Travel interruptions work .. sometimes (e.g., ISL, NZL, CAN-NL)
- Travel interruptions often do not work (e.g., world $\setminus$ very few)
- Governments like travel interruptions regardless
- Quarantine seems to work quite well but needs to be applied homogeneously
- Open Data has finally landed in public health. Still some issues (e.g., Canadian data), but we're moving in the right direction. Also saw emergence of scientist/journalistic/citizen data collection and dissemination initiatives

---

# Key questions/knowledge gaps

- How to get governments to understand that a pandemic is a **global** phenomenon with **local** "phenotypes", so that uncoordinated unilateral travel policies have virtually no chance of success (*treat the symtoms, not the cause*)
- How to apprehend/model the absolutely colossal amount of mobility taking place and the not less consequent variety of transport modalities and purposes 
- What are the necessary conditions for travel interruptions to work?
- Because of scapegoating, the borders were closed *in theory*. However, because of .. real life, they were not *in practice*. How closed is closed?

# Key questions/knowledge gaps (cont.)

- Effect of heterogeity of vaccination methods/protocols (vaccine type/number of doses/ages)
- What is the effect of local vaccine uptake discrepancies?
- Variants emerge typically in high propagation areas. How will the vaccine divide play into this?
